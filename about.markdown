Hi hi(((((: 

I am a Computer Science graduate @ UNSW, Sydney, who is actively seeking employment possibly within the tech field.

During my time in university, I involved in student-intiatied societies, including 
- IEEE UNSW branch(Unite the academics and industry leaders in the field of Electrical Engineering and Technology)
- Real Skills Education(Students Professional Development)
- Redback UNSW(Racing Car Teams)

Got to experience some of the programs and activities 
- Applied Consulting for Engineers (ACE) Program from EngSoc
- UNSW Graduate Advantage Program (GAP) in 2020
- The STEM Leaders Program Winter 2019 from Real Skills
- Hackathons
- Capture the Flag

Looking forward for talking about any interesting ideas. Or just chats! Let's connect! 

Cheers, 
Ann :)))))
