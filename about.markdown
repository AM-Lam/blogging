Hey! Welcome to my space.

Currently doing a computer science degree at the University of New South Wales in Sydney Australia.

As a contradicted person, I am interested in different aspects of the coding life, including but not limited to security, data analytics, and web dev. 

I have a kind of obsession with the programming language and competition, like a hackathon, coding comp, AND <bold>CTF</bold>. Open for study group or forming a team at all times!

You are having a great day :)))
